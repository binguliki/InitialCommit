# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

In this repository, you will find a collection of machine learning projects that I have developed. Each project is based on ideas provided in the blog post by [Strata Scratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/30-project-ideas-to-showcase-your-machine-learning-skills) and some of my own choices.

Feel free to explore the projects to see examples of my work and skills in machine learning.

## Introduction üìñ

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in machine learning. The projects included here cover a variety of topics and applications within the field. From predicting wine quality to building recommendation systems, each project showcases different techniques and methodologies employed in machine learning.

I have carefully curated these projects to provide a comprehensive overview of my abilities as a machine learning practitioner. Whether you're interested in regression, classification, anomaly detection, or deep learning, you'll find examples of my work in various domains.

I hope you find these projects informative and insightful. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.

## Future Work üîç

I plan to continue expanding this portfolio by adding more projects and exploring advanced machine learning techniques. Additionally, I encourage contributions from the community. If you find these projects useful or have ideas for improvement, feel free to fork this repository, create your own projects based on the existing ones, or suggest enhancements. Together, we can build a valuable resource for aspiring machine learning enthusiasts and practitioners.

Let's collaborate to make these projects even more impactful and beneficial to the wider machine learning community.
