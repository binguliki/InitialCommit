# Iris Flower Classification Model using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the well-known Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various features of Iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. With this model, new measurements of Iris flowers can be classified into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
