# Brain Tumor Detection Model using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## Overview 📝
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting brain tumors in MRI images using Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The model is trained on a dataset comprising MRI scans of patients with and without brain tumors. Once trained, the model can classify new MRI images into tumor or non-tumor classes.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used in this project is the [Brain Tumor Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) MRI dataset sourced from Kaggle. It contains MRI images of the brain collected from various medical institutions. The dataset includes images of patients with brain tumors as well as images of healthy individuals. Each image is labeled as either containing a brain tumor or being tumor-free.
